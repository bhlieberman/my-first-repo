I have had a dream—past the wit of man to say what dream it was. Man is but an ass if he go 
about to expound this dream. Methought I was—there is no man can tell what. Methought I was, and 
methought I had—but man is but a patched fool if he will offer to say what methought I had. The 
eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen, man’s hand is not able to taste, his 
tongue to conceive, nor his heart to report what my dream was.

To be or not to be, that is the question.

I am from Baltimore, Maryland. I live in Brooklyn, New York. I am an apprentice data analyst 
with Mile High Healthcare Analytics.
